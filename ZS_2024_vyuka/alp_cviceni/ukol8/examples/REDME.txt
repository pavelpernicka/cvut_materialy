Examples for HW08 easy and hard.

Notes for EASY+HARD 

Input is in ".txt" file, e.g. "easy-7777.txt".
Each possible solution has its own file (in form: easy-7777-sol-X-cost-Y.sol), where X is the number of that solution and Y is the cost of it (the cost is important only for hard HW).
If no "*.sol" file is given (i.e, no 'easy-7777*sol' exists), the output should be NOSOLUTION

Student programs can report any valid solution, not all of them.


Notes for HARD:
Only solutions with the highest cost are shown (the cost of the solution can be derived from its filename, see above note).
